        "description": "The Death Guard is a faction of Chaos Space Marines in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. They were once loyal Space Marines of the Emperor of Mankind, but were corrupted by the power of the Chaos god Nurgle, becoming twisted and decayed versions of their former selves. The Death Guard are known for their disgusting appearance, with their bodies covered in rotting flesh, pustules, and other signs of decay. They are also heavily armored and armed with a variety of weapons, such as boltguns, flamers, and plague knives. In battle, the Death Guard are incredibly resilient, able to shrug off even the most devastating attacks with their tough armor and powerful regeneration abilities. They are also skilled in the use of chemical and biological warfare, often using toxic gases and diseases to weaken their enemies before launching a full-scale attack.The Death Guard's devotion to Nurgle is absolute, and they believe that by spreading decay and disease throughout the galaxy, they are doing their god's bidding. They are led by a powerful Chaos Lord known as Typhus, who is himself a carrier of Nurgle's plagues and diseases.Overall, the Death Guard are a fearsome and revolting force on the battlefield, spreading death and decay wherever they go."
